    This function iterates through registered handlers and mounts them to the provided
    router using route configurations obtained from the route_resolver function. This
    design allows different handler types to provide their own routing logic without
    modifying this generic mounting code.

    The mounting process:
    1. Determine which handlers to mount (all registered, or a specific subset)

    3. Use the route_resolver to get the route configuration
